simple 2d simulator and visualizer

tie them together with a simple game logic example

each is a seperate component and they talk via local sockets


simulator process

game logic processor

visualizer processor


/tmp/sim.sock
/tmp/visualizer.sock

game logic processes talks to sim and visualizer
it acts as the driver for both


simulator has location data for all bodies
          and events on collisions (coming soon)
