SIM will receive and update the simulation based on:

add -- adds a new body to the simulation
 shape -- 'rectangle' 'circle'
 position -- starting position
 size

//rotate -- rotates a body in the simulation by its id
// body_id
// rotation -- radians

face -- rotates a body to face x,y
 body_id
 position: { x: <>, y: <> }

push -- applies force to a body in simulation by its id
 direction: { x: <>, y: <> }
 force

tick -- progresses the simulation one step


SIM will answer requests:

detail
 body_id
 request_id
 get: ['position','rotation']
=>
detail_response
 body_id
 request_id
 details: {
   position: { x: <>, y: <> },
   rotation: <radians>
 }

SIM will broadcast:

collision
 bodies: [body_id, body_id]
